## About Commercify

Commercify is an opensource eCommerce Engine, written for my book "Practical Laravel".

It uses the awesome Stisla dashboard theme and Laravel Modules to build a modular eCommerce store.

The book teaches the various aspects of CMS development, building an eCommerce store and a few other tricks.
